It has format:
name of place
number of reviews
date time rating review_text

Review Data:\n```{review_info}```

Now, your task is to provide a short summary for various parameters, deriving as much insights from the latest reviews as possible.

Basically, we want to have summary provide information that - "what are reviewers saying lately about this places's <...>". Give positive and negative aspects both. Be critical.

Output parameter:
<decide 5 most significant, concrete and unique parameters on your own. The parameters should tell about a specific aspect of the place. For example, in case of a restaurant, parameters can be food, ambience, parking, service etc.>


KEEP IN MIND:
- Do not output a 'overall' parameter.
- Rate the place on each parameter out of 5. This rating should be based on reviews (eg. if most reviews about parking are negative, give a low rating).
- Each parameter summary should not be more than 50 words.
